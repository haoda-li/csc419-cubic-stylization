# CSC419 Project - Cubic Stylization

This is a C++ implementation of <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/cubic-stylization/">Cubic Stylization [Liu, Jacobson, 2019]</a>.   
The cmake files and main is constructed based on <a href="https://github.com/alecjacobson/geometry-processing-deformation">the deformation assignment</a>. 
The demo program provides similar interaction functionalities as the deformation assignment, with some added tuning parameters for cubic stylization. 

## Installation and Compilation

Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/alecjacobson/geometry-processing-deformation">the Deformation assignment</a>

## Execution
Inside the `build` dir, run 
```
./cubic [path to mesh.obj]
```

Then, add at lest one  handle point by clicking on the mesh and hit SPACE to start the iterations. 

Then, available operations are listed in the stdout.
